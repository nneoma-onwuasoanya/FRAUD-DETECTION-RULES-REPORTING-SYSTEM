### FRAUD-DETECTION-RULES-REPORTING-SYSTEM

# Executive Summary
In this project, I developed a rule-based fraud detection system to identify suspicious activities in transaction data. Using Excel, I analyzed user behavior and implemented detection rules based on transaction patterns, thresholds, and anomalies.

#Problem Statement
Fraudulent transactions can lead to significant financial losses and damage user trust. This project aims to identify suspicious transaction patterns and design rules that can automatically flag potential fraud.
This analysis answers key questions such as:
What transaction patterns indicate potential fraud?
Which users trigger the highest number of fraud alerts?
What types of fraud occur most frequently?
